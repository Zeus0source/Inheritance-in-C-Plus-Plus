# Aim: To study and implement Inheritance
# Software Required:
Visual Studio
# Theory:
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP (Object Oriented Programming). It is the mechanism by which one class is allowed to inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class. Inheritance means creating new classes based on existing ones. A class that inherits from another class can reuse the methods and fields of that class.

Types of Inheritance in C++

1. Single Inheritance
In single inheritance, a sub-class is derived from only one super class. It inherits the properties and behavior of a single-parent class. Sometimes, it is also known as simple inheritance.

2. Multiple Inheritance
In Multiple inheritance, one class can have more than one superclass and inherit features from all parent classes.

3. Multilevel Inheritance
Multilevel inheritance in C++ means a class is derived from another derived class, forming a chain of inheritance.

4. Hierarchical Inheritance
In hierarchical inheritance, more than one subclass is inherited from a single base class. i.e. more than one derived class is created from a single base class. For example, cars and buses both are vehicle.

<ins>Advantages of Inheritance in C++</ins>:
+ Code Reusability : Derived class can directly reuse data members and methods of its base class, avoiding code duplication.
+ Abstraction : Supports abstract classes (classes with pure virtual functions) that define a common interface, enforcing abstraction.
+ Class Hierarchy : You can build hierarchies (base → derived → further derived) to model real-world relationships.
+ Polymorphism : Fully supports runtime polymorphism through virtual functions, and also compile-time polymorphism via function overloading and templates.
